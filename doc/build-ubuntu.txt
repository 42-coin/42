# Building GUI and headless client for Ubuntu Linux

## Preparations

First step, install all dependencies:

 sudo apt install build-essential libdb++-dev libssl-dev cmake qtdeclarative5-dev qttools5-dev libboost-all-dev libpng-dev git

Then, clone repository recursively:

 git clone --recursive https://github.com/42-coin/42

## Building GUI client

Create build directory:

 mkdir 42/build_qt && cd 42/build_qt

Configure build files:

 cmake ..

Compile:

 make -j 4

After everything will be done the resulting 42-qt executable will be created in your build directory.

## Building headless client

It's almost identical to steps for GUI client.

 cd ..

Create build directory:

 mkdir src/build_d && cd src/build_d

Configure build files:

 cmake ..

Compile:

 make -j 4

 strip 42d
	
The resulting 42d executable will be created in the build directory.
